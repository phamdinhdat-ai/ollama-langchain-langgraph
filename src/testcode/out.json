Who is the Best Football Player in the World Now (In 2024) Lionel Messi has dominated the football world for over a decade, often considered the best player globally. Best Football Players in the World Ranked 2024 - FAQs Who is currently considered the best football player in the world?\n===\nFull source content limited to 1000 tokens: Best Football Players in the World Ranked 2024\nC\nIn 2024, the ranking of the best football players in the world includes legendary names like Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Kylian Mbappé, Erling Haaland, and Robert Lewandowski. These top football players are known for their incredible talent, scoring records, and their ability to change the game. From Messi’s playmaking genius to Haaland’s powerful goals and Mbappé’s speed, these stars are the reason fans are so passionate about the sport.\nIn this article, we’ll look at the highest-ranked football players in 2024 based on their performances in elite leagues, such as the English Premier League, La Liga, and the Champions League. We'll explore what makes each of these top players unique, their impact on the field, and how they've earned their spot as the world's best football players this year.\nTop 10 Football Players in the World\nHere are the best footballers with top ranking in 2024:\n1. Kylian Mbappé (Real Madrid): A World Cup-Born Megastar.\nMbappé has become a global superstar thanks to his outstanding performances in the World Cup. Unlike today’s common paths to fame in the Champions League or Premier League, his rise through international competitions has proven his exceptional talent and mental strength.\nMuch like Neymar and Messi, Mbappé has dominated Ligue 1, but his skills on the world stage—both for club and country—make him truly stand out. His hat-trick in the 2022 World Cup final is already legendary, showcasing his ability to perform at the highest level under immense pressure.\nAt 25, Mbappé has not only the speed to outrun almost any opponent but also unique shooting skills. Whether he’s striking from a standstill or on the move, his powerful shots make him a constant threat. He can curl shots into the corners or hammer them high into the net—if he sees an opening, he’ll take it without mercy.\nNow playing for Real Madrid, Mbappé is expected to finish the season with a huge number of goals and, most likely, add several trophies to his career achievements. His mental toughness and focus on winning have firmly placed him among the world’s elite players.\nAchievements:\nWith AS Monaco:\nWith Paris Saint-Germain:\nWith the France National Team:\nKylian Mbappé has rapidly ascended to football superstardom, showcasing his talent and mental fortitude on the global stage. His hat-trick in the World Cup final stands as a testament to his exceptional skills and big-game prowess.\n2. Harry Kane (Bayern Munich)\nHarry Kane has been making headlines at UEFA EURO 2024 with his crucial contributions to England's progress in the tournament. Recently, in a dramatic last-16 match against Slovakia, Kane scored a vital goal in extra time, securing a 2-1 victory for England. This win ensured England's place in the quarter-finals, where they will face Switzerland. Kane's goal came just 50 seconds into the additional period, following a stunning equalizer by Jude Bellingham in the dying moments of regular time​.\nWith Tottenham Hotspur:\nWith Bayern Munich:\nWith England National Team:\nThe England captain's finishing is exemplary, his positioning to accommodate for a lack of raw pace is second-to-none, though his unique selling point is his uncanny playmaking ability, to pick a pass from deep, to swing a cross in, to play the No.10 and No.9 roles simultaneously and effectively and he achieved all of that in a Tottenham team that, with the greatest respect, was simply not at his level and rarely has been near his standard. He is the greatest natural No.9 in world football right now.\n3. Erling Haaland (Man City): The Prolific Goal Machine\nErling Haaland continues to dominate headlines with his remarkable performances for Manchester City. The Norwegian striker recently secured his second successive Premier League Golden Boot by scoring 27 goals in the 2023-2024 season, outpacing Chelsea's Cole Palmer, who scored 22 goals. Haaland's incredible goal-scoring prowess has been pivotal in Manchester City... [truncated]",

Ah, you're still finding out. You should know this: Driblab continues to revolutionise data analysis in football.\nWe have a vast array of metrics related to the physical performance of players. From total distance covered to sprints performed per match. Several of them are old classics: who hasn't heard the phrase âthe winning team out-run their opponentsâ or âthe losing team lacked intensityâ?\nWith our Physical Data, you can answer these questions easily, and also do a more in-depth analysis because we have other metrics that people are not so familiar with, and are certainly of wider interest. Today we focus on one of them: High Speed Runs (HSR), which are movements in which a player moves at a speed that is equal to or greater than 5.5 m/s (19.8 km/h) and less than 7 m/s (25.2 km/h).\nFor HSR, we have two other metrics: HSR distance and HSR quantity. Let's look at this in more depth using the example of several footballers.\nIf we look at the Premier League, Curtis Jones averages the most High Speed Runs per game (55.9). His role, more often than not, is that of a support player, appearing in different areas of the pitch. He is a compensator player, which means he moves around a lot on the pitch. He does not have a fixed position and his minutes are distributed as follows: 32% as a defensive midfielder, 7% as an interior and 57% as an advanced or attacking midfielder.\nNot only does he average the most High Speed Runs (HSR) among players with at least 700 minutes played, he also has the most distance covered in HSR. Compared to other midfielders in Europe's big five leagues, Jones averages the 10th most distance covered per game, but also the 2nd most HSR and the most distance covered in HSR per game.\nEvery footballer is different: Atletico de Madrid's Koke travels a further 400 meters on average than Jones. However their High Speed Runs number are clearly the opposite. LaLiga's slower pace benefits Koke, who at 33 no longer has the capacity to repeat such prolonged and intense efforts. HSR's share of the total distance covered is 6.93% for Koke and 8.89% for Jones. Yet, Koke averages a larger distance covered per game: the largest in Europe's top 5 leagues. \nThere are plenty of reasons that could explain this. One could be that Koke moves at a more constant speed than Jones, who's more of a irregular player in terms of the speed at which he's moving. His movement varies between moments of rest in which he barely moves from his position and moment of high intensity, which in turn require longer rests. \nWe clearly see this contrast in regards to the number of sprints each of them completes per game: Jones performs more than twice as many as Koke. \nCurtis Jones is the Premier League most intense player. His percentage of HSR distance accounts for 8.89% of the total distance he travels during a match, the 2nd highest number in the league. On top of that his share of Sprint distance accounts for 7.41% of the total distance. Sprints are movements in which the player travels at a speed that is greater than or equal to 7 m/s (25.2 km/h). So, most of Jonesâ total distance covered is made of high-speed, high-intensity movements. Some players, like SoumarÃ© or Tonali, find it hard to reach full speed. This means that they mostly cover distance by moving at a moderate pace or through HSR, but not by sprinting. \nIt's really hard to keep running at top speed. That's why we mostly see attackers in the top left corner of the Scatter Plot below. Players like Diallo, Gakpo, Garnacho and Mavididi need to be quick when they're one-on-one with their opponents, and they often use high-speed runs to get the upper hand. As a consequence, they usually travel fewer distance than most players because of the intensity those actions demand. Curtis Jones, on the other hand, is able to cover so much ground while still making high-intensi... [truncated]",
